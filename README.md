<h1>Mac OS Calculator</h1>

<p>This project is a Mac OS-inspired calculator created using .NET 7 WPF in Visual Studio. It provides a variety of functions and features similar to those found in the Mac OS calculator. The calculator utilizes the power of DataTable for performing calculations. Additionally, during the development process, I gained a basic understanding of MVVM technology.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mac OS-inspired design: The calculator interface is designed to resemble the sleek and minimalist look of Mac OS calculators.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive functionality: Most of the standard calculator functions are available, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations (currently with minor problems).</li>
  <li>Utilization of DataTable: The calculator employs DataTable for carrying out calculations, ensuring accurate and efficient mathematical operations.</li>
  <li>MVVM technology: Throughout the development process, I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which provides a structured and maintainable approach to building WPF applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
